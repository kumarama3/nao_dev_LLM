GRADUATE PROGRAMS
2.1 The MS and PhD Degrees
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers two graduate degrees:
• the Master of Science (MS), and
• the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).
2.2 Admission to the Graduate Programs
Students may apply into either the MS or the PhD program. On successfully completing the MS program, a student may apply for entry into the PhD program. Students admitted to the MS program will be
admitted to one of several tracks (see Section 3.1).
2.3 Admission to the PhD Program from the MS Program
Any MS student who is completing the breadth course requirements specified in the PhD Qualifying
Process and who has made arrangements with a major professor (see §4.2) may apply to the Graduate
Admissions Committee for admission to the PhD program.
The application should be submitted by the normal deadlines for PhD admissions (typically in September for Spring admissions, December for Fall admissions). Exceptions will be considered on a case-bycase basis.
The University has ruled that a change of program requires a new application on the Application
Management System. The most important materials for an MS-to-PhD program application are:
1. A letter from the prospective major professor testifying that the two of you have established a research relationship, and speaking to your promise for PhD study. This replaces the “Letters of Reference,” and is normally sent directly and privately to the Graduate Admissions Committee. It can
also be submitted online using the Application Management System (https://ubseasconnect.buffalo.edu/apply/).
3
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
2. A one-or-two-page “Statement of Purpose” describing your plans for doctoral research.
3. The form for Application by MS Students for Admission to the PhD Program
4. A copy of your UB transcript, plus a separate list of grades in courses you intend to transfer for PhD
use, or have already transferred, if any.
5. Financial documentation (international students only).
Note that the CSE department may not be able to promise financial support for the first year of PhD
study at the time the student is admitted to the PhD program.
MS students who cannot complete the breadth course requirements specified in the PhD Qualifying
Process by the end of their 2nd year or who have not made an arrangement with a major professor by the
end of their 2nd year will not be admitted to the PhD program.
2.4 Advisors
Upon admission, you are assigned an academic advisor. This person is not necessarily your “major professor” (i.e., research supervisor) for the MS project or thesis (as defined in §3.5.1) or the PhD dissertation
(as defined in §4.2). When you have come to an agreement with a major professor, that person will become your academic advisor as well. You may request a change of academic advisor at any time. All
students and academic advisors are urged to meet at least once each semester to review the student’s
progress and course of study.
2.5 Approval of the Director of Graduate Studies
From time to time, you may need to get the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies on various
documents. Often, you will first need the approval of your academic advisor, so you should always speak
to your advisor first. To get the Director’s signature on any forms, please give them to the Graduate
Coordinator, who will prepare a packet of relevant supporting documentation and give it to the Director
for his or her signature.

PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER
OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE &
ENGINEERING
3.1 Degree Requirements
Students admitted with a start date prior to Fall 2023 are considered to be in the Research Track. As part
of the application process, students will be admitted to the MS Degree Program in one of three tracks: (i)
Research Track, (ii) Systems Course Track, or (iii) AI/ML Course Track.
3.1.1 Degree Requirements for Students in All Tracks
1. Maintain continuous registration. In particular, you must be registered for at least one graduate
credit the semester prior to degree conferral. Registration in summer or winter sessions is not
required.
2. Fulfill the minimum residency requirement of 24 UB credits of registration.
3. Complete 10 courses, totaling 30 hours of graduate credit—subject to certain constraints when
receiving two master’s degrees (see Graduate School Policies and Procedures).
3.1.2 Degree Requirements for Students in the Research Track
Students in the research track must complete courses as follows:
• CSE 501: Introduction to Graduate Study in Computer Science (1 credit)
• 4 CSE 500-level breadth (core) courses, one from each focus area defined in §3.2 (3 credits each).
Your average grade across these four core classes must be at least a B (individual classes may be
below a B, as long as the average is at least a B).
• 2 additional CSE focus area course (breadth OR depth) courses (3 credits each) from the same focus
area. At least one of these two courses must be a 600-level course. The other can be 500- or 600-
level.
5
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
• 1 additional CSE focus area course (breadth OR depth) 500- or 600-level course, which may be from
any focus area (3 credits).
• 8 credits of electives, which have to include 1-2 credits of CSE 700-level seminar and which can
include at most 6 credits in approved classes outside of CSE (see Section 3.2.8). Typically, students
take 2 credits of seminar and 6 credits of independent study or thesis guidance to complete their
capstone project.
There is a distinction between breadth courses and depth courses:
1. Focus areas are the 4 areas listed in §3.2. The courses within each focus area are called focus area
courses (, and are divided into two categories: breadth courses (listed in §3.2.1) and depth courses
(listed in §3.2.2).
2. Breadth courses are CSE 500-level introductory courses in the focus areas, as listed in §3.2.1. From
time to time, these lists may change, depending on faculty availability and teaching interest.
3. Depth courses are CSE 500- and 600-level and specialization courses in the focus areas, as listed in
§3.2.2. From time to time, these lists may change, depending on faculty availability and teaching
interest.
4. There are also CSE 500- and 600-level courses that are not assigned to any focus area; these can be
taken as electives.
CSE 700-level seminars may be taken for 1, 2, or 3 credits. Normally, you would register for 2 credits
(plus 1 credit for CSE 501). However, under certain circumstances, you may want to register for 1 or 3
credits to attend a seminar course.1
Typical 1st-Semester Programs An unsupported 1st-semester student would normally take CSE 531 or
CSE 596, and 3 more CSE 500-level core/core-area courses, for a total of 12 credits (which is the minimum
number of credits required to be full time for an unsupported student).2 Note that almost all MS students
fall under this category.
A supported 1st-semester student would normally take CSE 531 or CSE 596, and 2 more CSE 500-level
core/core-area courses, for a total of 9 credits (which is the minimum number of credits required to be
full time for a supported student).
Capstone Project Students in the research track must complete a capstone project3
. The capstone
project can take one of two forms:
1. An MS thesis(which could be done, e.g., by registering for 6 credits of CSE 799: Supervised Research
as your two electives.
(See §3.5.2 for further details.)
1For example, one might want to take a seminar for 1 credit and another for CSE 598: Internship.
2A 700-level seminar might be “lighter” in workload compared to a typical 500-level course. You are advised to seek a manageable workload, especially in the first semester as a graduate student at UB CSE.
3The capstone requirement is relaxed for BS/MS students admitted to the research track: BS/MS dual-degree students may
use a project developed as part of a 600-level class, .
6
3.1. Degree Requirements
2. An MS project approved by a supervising faculty member.
(See §3.5.3 for further details.)
3. [BS/MS dual-degree students only] A project developed as part of a 600-level course in which (i)
you receive a grade of B+ or higher, and (ii) receive instructor approval.
3.1.3 Degree Requirements for Students in the Systems and AI/ML Course Tracks
All Course Track students must complete the following core classes. Your average grade across these core
classes must be a B or better.
1. CSE 521: Operating Systems (3 credits)
2. CSE 531: Algorithms (3 credits)
3. CSE 574: Intro to ML (3 credits)
4. CSE 587: Data Intensive Computing (3 credits)
5. CSE 565: Computer Security (3 credits)
All Course Track students must also complete 6 credits (typically 2 classes) of approved elective coursework, including:
• Any depth class from a different Course Track (e.g., a Systems Course Track student may take CSE
560 as an elective).
• Any approved non-CSE elective (see Section 3.2.8).
• CSE 598: Internship (up to 3 credits; See Section 3.2.9).
• CSE 611: MS Project Development (see Section 3.2.10)
All Systems Course Track students must complete the following additional depth classes:
1. CSE 562: Database Systems (3 credits; capstone)
2. CSE 589: Modern Network Concepts (3 credits)
3. CSE 590: Computer Architecture (3 credits)
All AI/ML Course Track students must complete the following additional classes:
1. CSE 676: Deep Learning (3 credits)
2. CSE 560: Data Models and Query Languages (3 credits)
3. CSE 573: Computer Vision (3 credits; capstone)
The courses marked ‘capstone’ above represent a synthesis of all topics covered prior to that point. You
must earn a B- or better in your capstone class.

All CSE courses not listed above (and not “restricted” in any way; see §3.2.3) are additional eligible choices
for the electives and the 500- or 600-level course which is not required to be from the same focus area.
As always, any exceptions to the above are petitionable to GSC.
3.2.3 Restrictions
1. The following courses cannot be counted towards the MS degree:
• CSE 501: Introduction to Graduate Studies in CSE
(this course is offered exclusively to PhD students)
• CSE 503: Computer Science for Non-Majors I
• CSE 504: Computer Science for Non-Majors II
• CSE 507: SOA and Web Services for non-Majors
11
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
• CSE 544: Machine Learning and Society for non-Majors (Take CSE 540 instead)
• CSE 699: Supervised Teaching
• MGS 610: Digital Forensics
• MGS 613: Database Management Systems (Take CSE 560 instead)
• MGS 614: Systems Analysis and Design (Take CSE 542 instead)
• MGS 618: CRM Apps Consulting Practices (Take CSE 611 instead)
• EAS 503: Programming and Database Fundamentals for Data Scientists (Take CSE 560 instead)
2. At most three credits for CSE 598 (Internship) can be counted toward the MS degree.
3. According to the UB Graduate School’s Grading Procedures, “No more than 25 percent of required
course credits in a student’s graduate program (not including courses taken as research, thesis,
project, portfolio, or dissertation guidance) shall be graded on an S/U basis.” In practice, this
means that at most 7 credits of seminar courses and/or CSE 598 that are graded S/U can be counted
towards the MS degree.
4. In accordance with New York State Education Department (SED) regulations, the percentage of
courses taken through distance education must be less than 50% of a graduate student’s degree
requirements. The pertinent SED policy is summarized on the following website:
http://www.highered.nysed.gov/ocue/ded/reviewoptions.html
5. At most one of the following courses can be counted towards the MS degree:
• CSE 519: Object-Oriented Techniques
• CSE 523: Quality Software Design
• CSE 525: Software Testing
• CSE 539: Software Engineering Tools and Building Blocks
• CSE 542: Software Engineering Concepts
• CSE 553: Software Development Project Management
3.2.4 Transferring Credits
You may transfer up to 6 graduate credits from outside the CSE department, subject to the approval of
both your academic advisor or major professor and of the Director of Graduate Studies. This includes
any non-CSE UB courses taken to satisfy the electives. The graduate school’s transfer credits requirement
states that “no more than 20% of a master’s program can be comprised of credits from another graduate
program at UB, other accredited higher education institutions, or a combination thereof.
Only those graduate courses deemed relevant to CSE and completed with letter grades of B or better
are eligible for consideration as transfer credit. If you transfer a course that is the equivalent of a CSE
course, you may not take the equivalent CSE course here. Credits for courses taken under a quarter
system are converted to UB equivalents.
To transfer courses, you need to complete the CSE “Transfer Credit Form” (available outside the Graduate Coordinator’s office), attach the transcript, the syllabus of the course being transferred, and other
12
3.2. Focus Areas and Breadth/Area classes
relevant information, and submit them first to your advisor and then to the Director of Graduate Studies
for approval. The form needs to be submitted before or at the time the “Application to Candidacy” (ATC)
form is submitted.
Getting transfer credit for a course that duplicates a CSE 500-level course does reduce by one the
number of 500-level CSE courses that you must take. If it is a breadth course, then it also fulfills the
requirement in that focus area (it automatically gives a waiver, as described below). Getting transfer
credit that duplicates a CSE 600-level course in a focus area, however, does not exempt you from the
requirement of a CSE 600-level course from a focus area; in other words, you must take one 600-level
depth or breadth course here at UB.
The Director of Graduate Studies will note all cases of duplicated courses on the Transfer Credit Form,
and such notation shall prevent the student from taking the duplicated course and applying credit for it
to any UB CSE degree.
These rules effectively translate the University’s 24-credit residency requirement4
into a 24-credit CSE
residency requirement, because the MS program normally requires at least 24 credits of CSE courses!
A student who transfers two courses from another institution (i.e., from outside UB) cannot then take
non-CSE UB courses (e.g., from EE, ISE, MGS, etc.) as part of their master’s program. To clarify: Such a
student can take such a course, but it will not be able to be counted towards the master’s program.
Courses taught by CSE Adjunct Professors (on the Graduate Faculty) but numbered in other departments do not count as CSE courses; they require “transfer” approval. However, a CSE course, including
CSE 700 or CSE 799, or a course crosslisted with a CSE course, taken with such a faculty member would
count as a CSE course.
3.2.5 Waiving Requirements
If you have already taken a graduate course similar to a required breadth course, you may apply to the
DGS for a waiver of that breadth course. Such waivers can be granted by the DGS after evaluation of your
transcript (including the syllabus of the course proposed to replace the breadth course) and discussion
with you, in consultation with the faculty member(s) who teach(es) that course. Normally, demonstrating
that you received a grade of B or better in one or more graduate courses covering the same material will
suffice.
If you have had a CSE 400-level analog of a 500-level CSE breadth course at UB that is double-listed
as CSE 4/5xx (such as CSE 4/531), then you may apply to the DGS for a waiver for the corresponding
CSE 500-level breadth course.5
To petition for a waiver of a breadth course, you must submit a request via email to the DGS for approval and attach other relevant information (copy of your transcript and syllabus of the course proposed
to replace the breadth course).
Having a breadth course waived does not exempt you from the requirement of 24 credits of CSE
courses at the 500- or 600-level. Nor does it reduce the number of CSE 500- or CSE 600-level courses
you must take—both of these would require getting actual transfer credit for the course. Note that there
are restrictions on using courses for one degree that have been used for another degree—see “Double
Dipping” below.
Therefore, having a breadth course waived requires you to replace that breadth course, and it allows
you to replace it with any other 500- or 600-level CSE course that counts toward the MS degree.

5https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.degree-requirements.html#title_1714762165
13
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
You should initiate the process at least one semester before the course desired to be waived is offered.
In addition, it is to your advantage to discuss such waivers with relevant faculty members and solicit their
support in writing before submitting your petition to the DGS.
3.2.6 “Double Dipping”
If you have received a graduate degree from another department at UB, or are in the process of receiving
one, then only up to 6 credits from another degree program can be used to satisfy your master’s degree
requirements in CSE. Put another way, at least 24 credits must be “unique to your MS program.”
For example, if you have used CSE 505 and CSE 590 for a master’s degree in mathematics, then you
may also use them for the master’s degree in CSE, but you may not use any other courses from your
mathematics master’s program for the CSE master’s, because that would exceed the 6-credit limit. Continuing the example, if you also used CSE 521 for your mathematics master’s, you would still only be able
to count two of CSE 505, CSE 521, and CSE 590 towards your CSE master’s degree.
No course can be “triply” counted. For example, if you have taken CSE 521 for your MS and PhD
degrees in electrical engineering, then you cannot use CSE 521 for your CSE degree.
3.2.7 Independent Study
You may also receive credit for independent study with a faculty member (CSE 700). After discussing
the work to be performed with the faculty instructor, use the SEAS Force Registration Portal to submit a
request to register under the specific faculty member’s section before the semester add/drop deadline.
3.2.8 Electives
The normal course requirements for an entering student with no background in computer science and
engineering at the graduate level include 9 credits of elective courses that may be approved graduate
courses transferred from outside UB or from other departments at UB. Those credits have to include at
least one seminar and at most 6 credits of non-CSE courses.
If you wish to choose elective courses in departments outside CSE, you must first consult your CSE
advisor. The usual criteria for approving a non-CSE course are that either the course focuses on a CSE,
Science, or Engineering issue, or it is instrumental to your MS project or thesis research. For example,
courses that teach only programming skills in certain packages, with no significant Computer Science
foundation component, will not normally be approved, unless those skills are needed for your research.
These are merely guidelines for you and your advisor; in general, if your advisor approves your electives,
so will the Director of Graduate Studies.
The following is a list of elective courses in departments outside CSE, which have already been approved – you do not need approval from the DGS for any of these courses:
• ART 543: Computational Media II — Machine Learning
• CSE/LIN/PHI/PSY 575: Intro to Cognitive Science
• DEE 501: Engineering Education
• DEE 502: Equity and Inclusion in Engineering Education
• DEE 520: Computing Education Research

GRADUATE HANDBOOK
3.2.9 Internship Option
Students in good academic standing may count internship work towards academic credit.
International MS students are never allowed full-time CPT during the regular Fall/Spring semesters
(even if they are only working on a project or thesis). Full-time CPT (40 hours) is only allowed during the
summer and winter semesters. International MS students can do part-time CPT (20 hours) during their
final semester, as long as the internship is based locally in Buffalo, or they are able to complete the work
remotely from Buffalo.
International students completing a project, thesis, or dissertation are exempt from the usual parttime limit, and may take a full-time (40 hours) and/or remote CPT during a Fall/Spring semester if: (i)
They have already completed all normal coursework requirements (i.e., the only degree requirements
unfulfilled are Thesis Guidance, Independent Study, and/or the Project/Thesis); and (ii) It is not their
final semester.
At most 3 credits of CSE 598 may be counted toward the credits required for the MS degree. CSE 598
is graded on an S/U basis, and counts along with seminars against the limit of 7 credits of S/U-graded
coursework.
An internship in a Fall or Spring semester that interrupts the normal program of study may be approved only if all of the following are satisfied:
• the semester is not the student’s final semester (or the internship is part-time),
• the student is in good academic standing,
• the student is doing (or has completed) an independent project or MS thesis,
• the student’s internship is integral to the established curriculum of the degree program,
• the student is registered for at least 1 credit of a course related to the project in that semester (Typically CSE 589 or CSE 800), and
• the student has filed an Application to Candidacy (ATC) that has been approved at the department
level.
3.2.10 MS Project Development
CSE 611: MS Project Development provides CSE graduate students with an alternative to internships. In
this non-standard class, students form groups and work together with a member of the community (e.g.,
local companies, entrepreneurs, or UB faculty) to design, implement, and document a proof-of-concept
system. Students are closely advised by a member of UB faculty with industry experience.
This is not a programming class: students are expected to know how to write and troubleshoot programs of significant complexity, and to acquire new technical knowledge as necessary. The main learning
objectives are related to teamwork, product development, client management, and navigating the tradeoffs and challenges of creating an application for use in the real world.
Admission to CSE 611 is limited; Students must contact the course instructor to apply.
16
3.3. Grade Requirements
3.3 Grade Requirements
In the program submitted for graduation, you must have at least 30 graduate credits with at least a 3.00
grade-point average (GPA) in an approved combination of courses. No more than 2 C or C- grades and
no D or F grades are allowed in the credits you use for the MS degree. The U grade indicates failure and
cannot be counted towards the required credits. No more than four R grades are allowed.
Note that your GPA as computed by the university (and listed on your transcript) will differ from your
GPA as computed by CSE for your degree. CSE considers all courses that can be counted towards the
candidate’s degree, whether or not listed on the application to candidacy (ATC), and the highest grade in
every non-repeatable course (repeatable courses include research, seminar etc.). The university considers all the courses attempted, including repeats. Our policy is in accordance with the graduate school’s
policy.6
In addition, SEAS uniform policy requires that the total of at most two repeat attempts can be
made: one course repeated twice or two courses repeated once each.
An S or U grade will not affect your GPA. Seminars and research are graded on an S/U basis. Independent Study is letter-graded. The UB Graduate School’s Grading Procedures requires that “no more
than 25% of the required credits in a student’s graduate program—excluding courses taken as thesis and
project research—shall be graded on an S/U basis.” Because 25% of 30 rounded down is 7, this allows, for
example, for 6 credits of seminars plus 1 credit of CSE 598. SEAS uniform policy requires that S/U grades
can only be used for project, thesis, dissertation, or courses taken as independent research or seminar.
3.3.1 Probation
If at any time your overall GPA slips below 3.00, or you are not otherwise making satisfactory progress
toward the degree (as determined at the semesterly review of all graduate students by the faculty), you will
be put on probation. If you are on probation: (i) You must maintain a 3.0 semester GPA in each semester
you are on probation; (ii) You must achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA within 2 semesters of being put on
probation. Students to fail to meet these criteria will be dismissed from the program (see Section 8.2).
3.3.2 Approval of Course of Study
Approval of the full course of study for your degree is given on the Application to Candidacy (ATC) form
by the signature of the Chair of the Department or the Director of Graduate Studies. Although the university provides tools to track your progress towards completing your degree. It is your responsibility to
determine whether your program (i.e., course selection) is sufficient to meet the requirements. If you have
any doubts whether your course selection meets graduation requirements, discuss them with your advisor and/or the Director of Graduate Studies as soon as possible. For a summary of these requirements,
see the MS checklist available from the Graduate Coordinator.
3.4 Miscellaneous
1. Students pre-registering for courses will be limited to a maximum of 12 credits and one seminar per
semester to allow all students to register; These caps will be lifted on the first day of the semester
through the end of the add-drop period.
2. There is no foreign-language requirement for the MS degree.
6http://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.academics.html#title_750344727
17
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
3. There is no full-time residency requirement for the MS
4. If you are a full-time student, you must satisfy all requirements for the MS degree by the end of
your 4th semester in residence.
5. If you are a part-time student, the Graduate School limit of 4 years from entry into the MS program
applies.
3.5 The Master’s Thesis and Master’s Project
Research Track students must complete a capstone project: either a thesis or a substantial project. This
requirement is filled for Course Track students by their capstone class.
3.5.1 Major Professor
If you choose to complete an independent project or a thesis for your MS degree, it is your responsibility
to come to an agreement with a major professor, i.e., a research advisor, for your project or thesis. The
following members of the Graduate Faculty of the University are eligible to supervise CSE MS theses or
to direct independent CSE MS projects:
• Graduate or Associate Graduate faculty members of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
• Research, Adjunct or Affiliated faculty members of the department.
The department cannot guarantee that you will be successful in coming to an agreement with a major
professor.
An MS thesis must be approved by at least two faculty members, including your major professor, who
comprise your MS thesis committee. By Graduate School regulations,7
the thesis must be defended at an
oral examination. It must also be approved by either the Director of Graduate Studies or the Chair of the
Department, as indicated by their signing the M-form for your degree.
An independent MS project needs only to be approved by your major professor.
Before beginning work on an independent master’s project or thesis, you must fill out either the Master’s Thesis Form or the Master’s Project Form. On this form, you must write a one-paragraph description
that identifies the area of the thesis or project and the main problem(s) that it will address. This form
must be approved and signed by your major professor, by any other committee members, and by the
Director of Graduate Studies or the Chair of the Department.
3.5.2 Master’s Thesis
The MS Thesis involves doing research on a topic of mutual interest to the major professor and the student. It is expected that the thesis work should be of publishable quality. The contents can be:
• a survey of the state of the art in a well-defined area of computer science and engineering,
• a new solution to a well-motivated problem,
7https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html
18
3.5. The Master’s Thesis and Master’s Project
• a comparison of several solutions to a well-motivated problem,
• the design and implementation of an algorithm or method of reasonable difficulty.
• any other topic agreed upon by the student and their committee.
The recommended format of the master’s thesis is as follows.
(1) title
(2) abstract (200–300 words)
(3) introduction—definition of the problem, its importance, historical background
(4) solution of the problem
(5) conclusions—how much of the whole problem area was solved, what questions remain open, suggestions for future work
(6) bibliography.
The amount of time spent on the MS Thesis should be equivalent to 6 credits. Up to 6 credits of
CSE 799 (Supervised Research) or CSE 800 (Thesis Guidance) may be counted toward the 30 credits required for the MS degree. It is typical for students to start work on a thesis as part of a 600-level course,
and these three credits may be counted. There is no formal minimum on the number of credits of CSE 800
for which a student doing an MS thesis must register, but from 3 to 6 is usual.
An oral public defense of the MS thesis is required. The oral defense is attended by the candidate’s
major professor, the rest of the MS thesis committee, and other interested CSE faculty members and
students. The graduate coordinator must be notified of the date of the oral defense at least 2 weeks prior
to the defense date so that the defense may be advertised to the department.
For information on the format of the thesis (binding, electronic submission, copyrighting, etc.), see
the webpage “Master’s Candidate Requirements” and, in particular, the “Guidelines for Electronic Thesis/Dissertation Preparation and Submission” from UB’s Graduate School.
3.5.3 Master’s Project
If you choose to do an MS project you must complete a “Master’s Project Form”. The contents of an independent master’s project should be like that of a thesis but less complex. An initial specification of the
project will be given to the student, who is then expected to develop a more complete specification of the
project and also implement the resulting specs. Both these activities must be carried out in consultation
with the faculty supervisor(s); Unlike a Thesis, multiple advisors are not required. The student is also expected to make regular progress reports during the project. At the completion of the project, the student
is expected to present the project in a public setting like the Fall or Spring CSE Demo Day.
The format of the writeup for the master’s project should be like that of a thesis except that (3) and (5)
may be less comprehensive.
The amount of time spent on an independent MS Project should be equivalent to 6 credits. Up to
6 credits of CSE 799 (Supervised Research) may be counted toward the 30 credits required for the MS
degree. It is typical for students to start work on a project as part of a 600-level course, and these three
credits may be counted.
19
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
BS/MS Students may complete a project from a CSE 600-level course in which the student achieved
a grade of B+ or better. In this case, the faculty member who teaches the 600-level course acts as the
major professor, becomes the student’s academic advisor, and signs the required forms. The format and
write-up of the project are determined by that faculty member. The MS project form must be submitted
to the Graduate Coordinator during the semester in which the student will be graduating. Note that not
every 600-level course offers a project that can be used as an MS project.
3.5.4 Publication of Project or Thesis
Since master’s projects and theses require the joint effort of you and your major professor (and possibly
other members of the faculty), you should make no arrangements for publication without consulting
your major professor. Publication in the departmental Technical Report series does not preclude later
publication by other methods (see Section 7.2).
3.6 Degree Forms
It is your responsibility to file all necessary forms with the Graduate School for obtaining your degree.
See §4.9.2 for a description of these forms.
You must be registered for at least one graduate credit the semester prior to degree conferral. See
Appendix A for submission deadlines.
Form Number of Copies
M-Form Prepared by the Graduate Coordinator
Master’s Thesis 2, e-copy to the Graduate School;
e-copy to the Departmental Technical Report series
(see Section 7.2 for on-line submission instruction).
Master’s Project 1 to project advisor
others as advisor requires
For later reference, you should keep a copy of all forms you have submitted .
If you have received, or are in the process of receiving, a graduate degree (MS or PhD) from any other
department at UB, you must submit a copy of all ATCs for those degrees, together with any amendments,
before your ATC for a degree in CSE can be approved.

PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR
OF PHILOSOPHY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
& ENGINEERING
4.1 Degree Requirements
1. PhD students are required to maintain continuous registration until the degree is conferred.
2. The PhD degree requires 72 hours of graduate credit. Your precise program of study for the required
72 hours should be worked out by you with your faculty advisor. It will normally include the course
work associated with the PhD Qualifying Process together with a number of other CSE courses and
CSE seminars as described below. Your precise program of study must have the approval of your
advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies.
3. To become a PhD candidate, a PhD student must complete the PhD Qualifying Process consisting
of the following requirements:
a) Take CSE 501 : “Introduction to Graduate Study in CSE”1
b) Take four breadth courses from the list below, one from each of the four focus areas.

Get at least a B from each of the four courses. Average at least a B+ GPA in the four breadth
courses above. This is the breadth requirements part of the PhD qualification process.
c) Take two courses:
• A 600-level course with a grade of at least B+
• A 600-level (with grade at least B) or a seminar (with a passing grade of S)
• These two courses must belong to the same focus area. The list of 600-level courses listed
by focus area can be found in Section 3.2. Consult with your academic advisor or the
director of graduate studies regarding the area classification of a 700-level course.
d) Pass the Oral Qualifying Exam. (See Section 4.1.1 below.) Every student has two chances to
pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.
Requirements c) and d) constitute the depth requirements of the PhD qualification process.
The PhD qualifying process must be completed within the first 6 semesters of graduate study, and
verified by filing the “CSE PhD Qualifying Process Verification Form”. If you were originally admitted as an M.S. student to our department, then were admitted to the PhD program, then you must
complete the PhD qualification process within the first 7 semesters of graduate study (including
the time when you were in the M.S. program).
4. Take at least one CSE seminar with grade of S. This must be done before the end of the fourth year
of graduate study. (If you took a CSE seminar to satisfy part (c) of the PhD qualifying process, then
this requirement is satisfied.)
22
4.1. Degree Requirements
5. Submit and defend a Dissertation Proposal. This must be done before the end of the fourth year of
graduate study. (See Section 4.6 below.)
6. Submit and orally defend the Dissertation. (See Section 4.7 below.)
4.1.1 The Oral Qualifying Exam
The Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE henceforth) is the last component of the depth requirement for PhD
candidacy. The exam is meant to measure three essential qualities of a PhD candidate:
• the ability to create new knowledge,
• the depth of knowledge in the topic of study, and
• the ability to communicate knowledge in scholarly writing and in presenting.
The OQE is designed so that PhD students start a research relationship with an advisor as early as possible
in the PhD study. The OQE does not impose extra labor beyond what a PhD candidate will have to do
anyhow – that is to do research.
Since every student has two chances to pass the Oral Qualifying Exam, it is recommended that a fresh
PhD admit attempts the first OQE no later than the 5th semester, and an M.S. to PhD admit attempts to
take the first OQE no later than the 6th semester of graduate study. It is the student’s responsibility to
ensure that the eligibility requirements (see Section 4.1 Item 3.(a)-(d)) must be fulfilled before applying
for and taking the OQE.
The student prepares artifacts to demonstrate his/her (1) depth of knowledge in a topic, (2) ability
to create new knowledge, and (3) ability to communicate knowledge in scholarly writing.2These artifacts
form a portfolio to be submitted to the advisor, who will determine from the portfolio whether or not the
student is ready for the oral presentation. The advisor can help with kick-starting the portfolio preparation. The advisor might, for example, give the student a reading list of classic papers on a topic, and ask
the student to write a comprehensive report on it.
The OQE exam committee consists of three members. The exam is administered and chaired by the
student’s major PhD advisor. Once the student is ready, the student and the advisor select the second
OQE exam committee member. The student then submits the “Application for OQE” form and their
portfolio through email, at least 5 weeks before the anticipated exam date, to the Director of Graduate
Studies (DGS) and the Graduate Coordinator. Upon verification of the student’s eligibility for taking the
OQE, the DGS appoints the third member of the OQE committee – this member is called the independent
member – within 1 week of receiving the student’s portfolio. At this point, the student arranges/finalizes
the date and time for the OQE exam and works with the OQE committee to select a reading list. The
committee should finalize the OQE reading list at least 4 weeks before the OQE date. It is the student’s
responsibility to ensure that this reading list is finalized in a timely fashion. The OQE reading list consists
of a total of 3-6 papers assigned by all three committee members (each member can assign 1-2 papers).
If 2-3 committee members agree, their joint contribution to reading list can be replaced by a PhD Thesis.
In the OQE exam, the student orally presents the work constituting the portfolio, demonstrating that
she/he is capable of communicating knowledge orally. The presentation will be public, for about 30
minutes, followed by a question-answer session. The question-answer session is performed as closed
2Examples of artifacts can be: a conference paper that the student is the primary author of, a 600-level project report, the
technical report on a piece of software, a survey on a particular topic, new experimental and/or theoretical results on an open
question, lines of thoughts on how to attack an open problem, etc.
23
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
session; the audience leaves, and the OQE committee examines the student about the student’s portfolio
and the reading list. The OQE in total is limited to at most 90 minutes.
The student passes the exam if all three members give a passing grade. The student passes the exam
conditionally if only two members give a passing grade, which must include the advisor. The member
that does not give the passing grade will give specific recommendations as to how the student can improve, in what aspects of the above criteria to be worthy of a PhD candidacy. If at least two members give
a failing grade, then the student fails the exam. More details about grading can be found at the “CSE PhD
Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) Verification” form. The OQE committee members fill in and sign this form
at the end of the exam. The student then submits the form to the DGS with the final reading list attached.
4.1.2 Transferring Credits
The Graduate School requires that at least 36 credits of the 72 credits required for the PhD program must
be taken at UB, and must be unique to the PhD degree—i.e., not used for any other degree. Thus, up
to 36 credits of graduate work at another institution can be transferred, if approved by the Director of
Graduate Studies. Only those relevant graduate courses completed with grades of B or better are eligible
for consideration as transfer credit.
If you transfer a course that is the equivalent of a CSE course, you may not take the equivalent course
at UB CSE.
The Graduate School also requires that at least 36 credits be unique to the PhD degree. For example,
if you have obtained a CSE MS degree, you may use all 30 MS credits for your CSE PhD degree. However,
you are then allowed to transfer only 6 credits from another institution. If the MS degree itself included
6 transfer credits, these transfer credits could not be used toward the PhD degree and then you would be
allowed 12 additional transfer credits.
To transfer courses, you need to complete a “Transfer Credit Form.” Email the grad coordinator for
the necessary paperwork; When requesting paperwork, attach the transcript, the syllabus of the course
being transferred, and other relevant information, and submit them to the Director of Graduate Studies
for approval. This must be done by the time the Application to Candidacy (ATC) is filed, and should be
done as soon as you have determined which credits you wish to transfer.
4.1.3 Waiving Requirements
If you have already taken a course similar to a required breadth course, you may apply to the GSC for a
waiver of that breadth course. See §3.2.5 for details.
4.1.4 Independent Study
You may also receive credit for independent study with a faculty member (CSE 700). After discussing
the work to be performed with the faculty instructor, use the SEAS Force Registration Portal to submit a
request to register under the specific faculty member’s section before the semester add/drop deadline.
4.1.5 Grade Requirements
In the program submitted for graduation, you must have at least 72 graduate credits in the right combination of courses. No Ds or Fs are allowed in the 72 credit hours you use for the Ph.D degree. The U grade
indicates failure and cannot be counted towards the required 72 credits.
24
4.2. Major Professor
Supervised-research (CSE 799) and thesis-guidance (CSE 800) credit hours are counted towards the
72 hours for the PhD degree. These are graded as S/U. Seminars are also graded on an S/U basis. An S or
U grade will not affect your GPA. No more than four R grades are allowed.
Exclusive of S grades, courses to be submitted for candidacy must average B or better.
SEAS uniform policy requires that the total of at most two repeat attempts can be made: one course
repeated twice or two courses repeated once each.
According to UB Graduate School’s Grading Procedures, “No more than 25 percent of required course
credits in a student’s graduate program (not including courses taken as research, thesis, project, portfolio,
or dissertation guidance) shall be graded on an S/U basis.”
4.1.6 Internship Option
Students doing internships in a given semester (including the summer) may register for 1 credit of CSE 598:
Internship. This must be approved by the student’s advisor and the CSE Internship Coordinator. At most
1 credit of CSE 598 may be counted toward the 72 credits for the PhD degree. CSE 598 is graded on an
S/U basis.
A student who has not completed the “classroom” type courses cannot go on an internship during
academic semesters. Only students who have completed all “coursework” where only remaining work is
a project, thesis or dissertation, are eligible.
4.1.7 Miscellaneous
1. There is no foreign-language requirement for the PhD degree.
2. CSE 503, CSE 504, CSE 507, CSE 699 may not be counted toward your 72 hours for the PhD
4.1.8 Probation
If at any time your cumulative CSE GPA slips below 3.00, or you are otherwise not making satisfactory
progress toward the degree (as determined at the departmental review of all graduate students by the
faculty), you will be put on probation. (See §8.2 for details.)
4.2 Major Professor
Earning a PhD is largely an apprenticeship activity. The most important person to you as a PhD student
is your major professor (also called your “research supervisor” or “advisor”).
Full-time graduate faculty members of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering are
automatically eligible to supervise CSE PhD dissertations. Other UB Graduate Faculty can supervise CSE
PhD dissertations, subject to the approval by the CSE Personnel Committee.
Each of these people is eager to supervise good PhD students, but you must take the first step. As soon
as possible—but before the end of your second academic year—you should decide whom you would
like to be your major professor, approach that person, and begin to discuss possible research topics.
You might approach several possible advisors and discuss possible research areas with each one. The
potential advisor may ask you to do additional study and/or small projects to see if you, the topic, and
the potential advisor are mutually compatible. The final decision is mutual—both you and your advisor
are entering on a relationship that will last throughout your career.
25
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
The Department is not responsible for assigning you a major professor, nor does it guarantee that
you will be successful in finding one. Nevertheless, coming to an agreement with a major professor is a
necessary step to earning the PhD degree. You must have a major professor before you can choose the
rest of your dissertation committee, write a dissertation proposal, or write a dissertation.
Once you settle on a major professor, the two of you must officially notify the Department using the
Major Professor Form, which you both sign. This must be done before the end of your second academic
year. The major professor becomes your academic advisor as well.
Do not feel trapped! If you later decide to change your major professor, that is possible. First, however, discuss the situation with the Director of Graduate Studies. Changing your major professor will
probably delay the completion of your PhD However, it does not extend the time limit for completion.
4.3 Dissertation Committee
After passing the core-course requirements and coming to an agreement with a major professor, you
must assemble a PhD Dissertation Committee consisting of the major professor as chair, and at least
two additional members. These additional members must be chosen with the advice and consent of the
major professor, and they have the right to accept or refuse membership on the committee. Every PhD
Dissertation Committee must contain at least two tenured or tenure-track faculty members from the CSE
department. A PhD dissertation can be supervised by an adjunct faculty member, but then two other
members of the committee must be CSE tenured or tenure-track faculty. The Graduate School requires
that the supervisor and two members of the committee be members of the UB Graduate Faculty.
4.4 Admission to Candidacy
You officially become a PhD candidate when your “Application to Candidacy” (ATC) is approved by the
Director of Graduate Studies, the Divisional Committee of the SEAS, and the Graduate School. The Application to Candidacy form is filed with the Graduate School and indicates that the student is entering the
final stages of degree completion. Normally, students should expect to file an Application to Candidacy
after six semesters of full-time enrollment toward the doctoral degree and/or have passed or about to sit
for their doctoral preliminary qualifying examination (OQE).
Review and approval of the ATC is the responsibility of the student’s department and dean, in that
order. Some units also require divisional or area committee review prior to submission to the Graduate
School. Once admitted to candidacy, a student may not need to enroll for 12 credits (nine credits for
graduate, teaching and research assistants) to be certified as a full-time student.
According to the instructions on the form, it should be filed “after six semesters of full-time enrollment for students seeking a doctorate.” However, you may file it earlier, as long as:
• you have passed or about to sit for their doctoral preliminary qualifying examination (OQE),
• you know the general topic of your PhD research and can give a tentative dissertation title,
• you can tentatively list courses that you will use to obtain the 72 credit hours required for the PhD,
and
• you have a dissertation committee, including major professor, willing to sign the form.
26
4.5. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training Requirement
Other information required on the form may be projected and tentative. If you later change the list
of courses, your dissertation title, your major professor, or your committee, then you must file a petition
with the Graduate School. In general, you should file the ATC form as soon as you can. (See §4.8.)
If you have received, or are in the process of receiving, a graduate degree (MS or PhD) from any other
department at UB, you must submit a copy of all ATCs for those degrees, together with any amendments,
before your ATC for a degree in CSE can be approved.
4.5 Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training Requirement
All students admitted to the PhD program are required to document successful completion of “Responsible Conduct of Research” (RCR) training when they submit their Application to Candidacy (ATC) for their
PhD degree. This training requirement may be fulfilled by either:
(1) enrolling in and passing PHI 640 Graduate Research Ethics or RPN 541 Ethics and Conduct of Research or
(2) completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) online Responsible Conduct
of Research course with an average score of 80% or higher.
Students opting to complete the CITI online course must supply documentation of its successful completion with their Application to Candidacy. For more information, see:
https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.a-to-z.html#rcr-training
4.6 Dissertation Proposal
Before starting work on a dissertation, you must write a dissertation proposal that includes the following:
1. a statement of the problem and why it is important, including a bibliography of the relevant literature;
2. a discussion of how the problem will be approached; and
3. a projected outline of the dissertation.
Such proposals usually follow the guidelines of the Project Description of an National Science Foundation (NSF) grant proposal,3
including at least 15 pages at 11 or 12 point type, exclusive of references
and appendices. This proposal must be approved by your committee and will be circulated to the Department faculty for comments by the graduate coordinator. The following general outline is common
for grant proposals and is recommended for CSE dissertation proposals:
• Background: Statement of the problem, why it is important, and—very briefly—what you propose
to do;
• Prior Research (or “Literature Review”): what others have done on the topic, and how your work
will extend or improve theirs;
3https://nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg
27
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
• Current Status: what you have done so far;
• Proposed Research: what you intend to do, and how you intend to do it. This section should contain enough detail to make it clear that you know what you’re embarking on, and to demonstrate
that there is a good chance that you’ll succeed.
• Proposed outline of the dissertation.
The dissertation proposal should be finished and sent to the graduate coordinator for circulation
to all CSE faculty members about two weeks prior to the scheduled date of the oral presentation of
the proposal. The time and location of the oral presentation must also be announced to all CSE faculty
members.
After the oral presentation, the dissertation committee members indicate their approval of the proposal on the Dissertation Proposal Form. Email the graduate coordinator for the necessary paperwork.
The members of the Graduate Faculty of the Department have one week to express their opinions. If the
dissertation committee unanimously approves the proposal, and no more than one other faculty member casts a negative vote, the proposal is approved. Otherwise the proposal is rejected, but you and your
advisor have two ways of changing the outcome: (1) If you revise the proposal so that all members of
the committee approve it, and at least all but one of the other negatively voting faculty members change
their votes, then the revised proposal is approved. (2) Your advisor may bring the matter to a meeting of
the Graduate Faculty of the Department (called for the purpose, if necessary): If, after appropriate discussion, a majority of the faculty present and voting approve the proposal, it is approved; otherwise, it
is rejected, and you must either resign from the Department or go through the entire proposal process
again.
Your dissertation proposal should be approved by the Department as soon as possible. You must
have an approved dissertation proposal before the end of your fourth year. Failure to do so may result
in your being dropped from the doctoral program. You may petition the GSC for an extension if you think
there are bona fide reasons for requiring more time.
A copy of your dissertation proposal must be given to the Graduate Coordinator and will be kept in
your file.
4.7 Dissertation
For information on the format of the thesis (binding, electronic submission, copyrighting, etc.), see the
webpage “PhD Candidate Requirements” and, in particular, the “Guidelines for Electronic Thesis/Dissertation
Preparation and Submission” from UB’s Graduate School. The Electronic Thesis and Dissertation FAQs
should answer all of your questions regarding electronic submissions and formatting requirements.
In 2005, the University at Buffalo moved from accepting paper-based/bound copies to requiring only
electronic theses and dissertations for publishing and archiving in an electronic database. The archiving
is handled by ProQuest/UMI, the world’s largest recognized repository for dissertations and theses. UB
has contracted with UMI to publish, archive and disseminate graduate research.
The Department requires an on-line copy for the Departmental Technical Report series (see Section 7.2 for on-line submission instruction), as well as bound copies for each member of the candidate’s
dissertation committee. Each copy of a doctoral dissertation must include an abstract not longer than
600 words.
Because doctoral dissertations require the joint effort of you and your major professor (and perhaps
other members of the faculty), you should make no arrangements for publication without consulting
28
4.8. Schedule
your major professor. The electronic copy submitted to Graduate School and the publication in the departmental Technical Report Series do not preclude later publication by other venues.
4.7.1 Dissertation Defense
You must defend your dissertation orally in public when it is complete. The Department will not schedule
the defense of a dissertation until at least one year after the acceptance of the dissertation proposal.
However, a student who completes a dissertation unusually quickly may petition the GSC to allow the
defense less than a year after the proposal.
4.7.2 Outside Reader
No outside reader is required. However, an outside reader is permitted.
An outside reader is a qualified individual appointed outside the student’s department who normally
holds the highest degree in his or her field. Research or adjunct faculty of the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering are not eligible to serve as outside readers of Computer Science dissertations.
Wherever possible, departments are encouraged to invite faculty from other academic and professional
institutions to accept this professional responsibility. If the outside reader is chosen from within the
University, he or she would normally be a member of the graduate faculty of some other department.
The outside reader should be chosen by you in consultation with your major professor and the other
members of your committee. Since the purpose of having an outside reader is to obtain the benefit of an
objective expert’s opinion, it is obviously more appropriate to select as outside reader someone who has
not been associated with the research.
The outside reader provides an independent evaluation of the student’s research. Normally this
would be limited to an examination of the final draft of the dissertation. The department may invite
the outside reader to examine the next-to-final draft of the dissertation. Outside readers may ask the student to discuss the dissertation with them. Decisions regarding criticisms, recommendations for changes
in the dissertation, or additional work to be done are made by the major professor and the candidate’s
committee.
4.8 Schedule
Students in the PhD program must adhere to the following schedule:
1. The breadth course requirements in the PhD Qualifying Process must be completed by the end of
the second academic year.
2. A willing major professor must be chosen before the end of the second academic year. (It is recommended that this should be done in the first year.)
3. OQE must be successfully completed no later than the 6th semester. (OQE should be attempted no
later than the 5th semester, as the student gets only 2 chances to pass OQE.)
4. The Application to Candidacy (ATC) should be submitted by the end of the third year.
5. The dissertation proposal must be approved before the end of the fourth academic year.
29
GRADUATE HANDBOOK
6. All other requirements must be met by the end of the seventh (7th) academic year—this is a University requirement. Doctoral degrees must be completed within seven years from the student’s initial
formal matriculation in that doctoral program. Requests for extensions of time limits must be petitioned using the Extension of Time Limit to Complete a Degree Program form. Each divisional or
area committee may establish its own stricter policies within the constraints of these overarching
institutional policies.
Minor amendments to the ATC which become necessary through changes in registration (e.g.,
adding or deleting anticipated courses or credits) must be formalized through the Change of Expected Conferral Date/Amend ATC petition. This form must be endorsed by the director of graduate studies or chair of the student’s department. These amendments are then reviewed by the
Graduate School.
The definition of “end” of an academic year or semester for these and similar purposes is: the last day
of exams of that year or semester. Petitions for extensions should be sent to the GSC, or, in the case of
University deadlines, to the Graduate School.
A student should complete all PhD degree requirements (except the dissertation), complete at least
68 required credits, and file the ATC within the first four years of study. After this, the student may register
for only one credit hour per semester while maintaining full-time status.
These rules apply equally to all students, whether enrolled as full-time or as part-time students. A
leave of absence has the effect of stopping the clock. You need to file the Graduate School “Graduate
Student Petition Form” for this purpose. However, leaves will be granted only for pressing personal matters that unavoidably render a student unable to devote attention to graduate study. Leaves will not be
approved for students who intend to continue work toward the PhD while on that leave.
It is our intent that each student graduates with the PhD within six years, and the faculty will work
with you in this endeavor.
Note: You may find it odd that the ATC should be submitted by the end of the 3rd year, while the dissertation proposal must be approved before the end of the 4th academic year. Note, though, that the ATC
“should” but need not be submitted by the end of the 3rd year, while the dissertation proposal “must” be
approved before the end of the 4th. The wording about the ATC form comes from the Graduate School,
not the Department. In fact, the ATC only needs to be submitted a specified time before the graduation
date. But the earlier it is submitted, the earlier one can register for only one credit as a full-time student,
which is something the Graduate School encourages in order to promote work on the dissertation. In
general, the ATC should be submitted as soon as you know all the information it requests, such as committee members and title of dissertation. But you can submit it earlier, with tentative information. If the
information changes, you then may and must file an amendment to the ATC. (See §4.4.)
4.9 Documents and Degree Forms
4.9.1 Documents
There are departmental forms to be completed and approved by appropriate signatures for each of the
PhD requirements. These forms are available from the departmental Graduate Coordinator. Below is
a list of the forms required. All must be appropriately dated and signed as indicated on them. All require the signature of the Director of Graduate Studies. Normally, you would have your advisor sign the
forms, where needed, and then give the forms to the Graduate Coordinator, who will forward them, with
accompanying documentation, to the Director of Graduate Studies.
30
4.9. Documents and Degree Forms
1. Independent Study Forms (if applicable)
2. Transfer Credit Forms (if applicable)
3. CSE PhD Qualifying Process Verification Form
4. Major Professor Form
5. Dissertation Proposal Form
6. The M-Form
The M-form signifying that your dissertation defense has been accepted is prepared the student, and
is signed by all committee members and the Director of Graduate Studies or the Chair of the Department.
4.9.2 Degree Forms
You are responsible for filing all necessary forms with the Graduate School for obtaining your degree,
including the ATC Form.4 You must be registered for at least one graduate credit the semester prior to
degree conferral.
You should attach to the ATC the description of any seminars and independent studies you are offering toward the 72 hours for the PhD, including any hours previously approved by the GSC. Computer
science or computer engineering credits from another university will normally be approved pro-forma
for PhD credit, subject to the Graduate School limitation of at most 36 non-UB credits.
If you have received, or are in the process of receiving, a graduate degree (MS or PhD) from any other
department at UB, you must submit a copy of all ATCs for those degrees, together with any amendments,
before your ATC for a degree in CSE can be approved.
The M-Form is submitted to the Graduate School by the Graduate Coordinator, to certify that the dissertation was satisfactorily defended and that all requirements for the degree have been satisfied. This
form must be signed by the major professor, the committee members, and by the Chair of the Department or the Director of Graduate Studies.
For a summary of these Graduate School forms and deadlines, see Appendix A.

COURSE WORK
6.1 Courses offered
The official course descriptions of courses offered by the department can be found at:
https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/graduate/courses.html
You should be aware that some of these courses are offered only on an irregular basis.
6.2 Grading
The quantity and quality of all assignments in a course, including computer projects, will be such that
students taking the course can reasonably be expected to complete them by the last teaching day of the
semester or by the day of the final examination, whichever comes later.
6.2.1 Letter Grades
In accordance with university policy, letter grades for those graduate courses giving them are as follows:
A 4.00
A− 3.67
B+ 3.33
B 3.00
B− 2.67
C+ 2.33
C 2.00
C− 1.67
D 1.00
F 0.00
Note that there are no C−, D+, or D− grades in graduate courses.
35
6. COURSE WORK
6.2.2 S/U
All graduate seminars in the Department are graded S/U (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory). Independent
Study is letter-graded, and Supervised Research/Thesis Guidance, S/U- or L-graded. SEAS uniform policy
requires that S/U grades can only be used for project, thesis, dissertation, or courses taken as independent research or seminar.
According to UB Graduate School’s Grading Procedures, “No more than 25 percent of required course
credits in a student’s graduate program (not including courses taken as research, thesis, project, portfolio,
or dissertation guidance) shall be graded on an S/U basis.”
6.2.3 Incomplete Grades
A grade of I (Incomplete) will be given only in exceptional personal circumstances and will be decided
on a case-by-case basis. It will not be given to extend a term of study or to bail out of poor performance
in a course.
Once an I grade is incurred by a student, it must be removed after no more than two additional
semesters plus the intervening summer, e.g., according to the following schedule:1
Semester Received Must Be Removed by
Fall December 31 of the next calendar year
Spring May 31 of the next calendar year
Summer August 31 of the next calendar year
If the I grade is not removed by the specified date, the University will automatically change the I to a grade
of U (Unsatisfactory) or F.
If the actual date for removing an I is approaching, and if you have not yet completed the outstanding
work, you may petition the Graduate School for relief. The petition must be endorsed by the course
instructor and the Chair of the Department. The Graduate School will decide whether the circumstances
(e.g., poor health) warrant an extension.
Note that you cannot graduate with an I grade, whether or not the course in which you received
the I is being used for your degree (i.e., whether or not it appears on your ATC)!

COLLOQUIUM SERIES, TECHNICAL
REPORTS
7.1 Colloquium series
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering sponsors a colloquium series each semester. The
speakers include well-known researchers invited from other universities and research centers, as well as
UB faculty.
Attendance at departmental colloquia is both a privilege and a responsibility of all members of the
Department. You can learn a great deal about current research in a wide variety of areas of computer
science by attending these talks, especially if the topic is one that is not taught here at UB. And you will
have an opportunity to meet computer scientists from around the world.
Attendance at colloquia is required as part of CSE 501.
7.2 Departmental technical reports
7.2.1 Policy
Results of original research should always be published as a UB CSE departmental technical report, in
addition to other modes of publication.
1. PhD dissertations and master’s theses are required to be published as UB CSE technical reports.
2. Original student research not submitted as a thesis or dissertation but recommended by a faculty
member may be published as a departmental technical report.
7.2.2 Distribution
Reports are distributed on-line only. They are available on the World Wide Web at:
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/research/technical_reports/index.php
The information on how to submit a report is also available there.

PROBATION, ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND
DISCONTINUANCE OF STUDY
8.1 Review of Academic Progress
Each year, the entire faculty meets to review the progress of all graduate students in the Department.
Students who are not making satisfactory progress will be notified by mail and should meet with their
advisor and/or the Director of Graduate Studies to discuss the matter.
8.2 Probation
If at any time your cumulative CSE GPA falls below 3.00, or you are not otherwise making satisfactory
progress toward the degree, you will be put on probation.
If your cumulative CSE GPA falls below 3.00 at the end of any semester, you are automatically on
probation from the start of the next semester. When you are on probation:
• If your CSE semester GPA falls below a 3.0, you will be dismissed from the program
• If you achieve a cumulative CSE GPA of 3.0 at the end of any semester, you return to good standing.
• If you remain on probation (your cumulative CSE GPA remains below a 3.0) for more than 2 regular (Fall/Spring) semesters (4 semesters for part-time students), you will be dismissed from the
program.
Probation for other causes shall commence from your being notified in writing by the Graduate Studies Committee. In consultation with your advisor, you will be given requirements for regaining good
academic standing. Being on probation is grounds for withdrawal of academic financial support.
8.3 Academic Integrity
The academic degrees and the research findings produced by our Department are worth no more than
the integrity of the process by which they are gained. If we do not maintain reliably high standards of
ethics and integrity in our work and our relationships, we have nothing of value to offer one another or
to offer the larger community outside this Department, whether potential employers or fellow scholars.
39
8. PROBATION, ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND DISCONTINUANCE OF STUDY
For this reason, the principles of academic integrity have priority over every other consideration in
every aspect of our departmental life, and we will defend these principles vigorously. It is essential that
every student be fully aware of these principles, what the procedures are by which possible violations
are investigated and adjudicated, and what the punishments for these violations are. Wherever they are
suspected, potential violations will be investigated, and determinations of fact sought. In short, breaches
of academic integrity will not be tolerated.
8.3.1 University Statements on Academic Integrity
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering endorses and adheres to the University policy on
academic integrity. Students should be familiar with that policy, as expressed in the following documents:
• UB Academic Integrity Policies:
https://academicintegrity.buffalo.edu/policies.php
• UB Graduate School Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures:
https://grad.buffalo.edu/succeed/current-students/policy-library.html#academic-integrity
8.3.2 Departmental Statement on Academic Integrity in Coding Assignments and Projects
This statement further describes the specific application of these general principles to a common context
in the CSE Department environment, the production of source code for project and homework assignments. It should be thoroughly understood before undertaking any cooperative activities or using any
other sources in such contexts.
All academic work must be your own. Plagiarism, defined as copying or receiving materials from a
source or sources and submitting this material as one’s own without acknowledging the particular debts
to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or otherwise representing the work of another as
one’s own, is never allowed. Collaboration, usually evidenced by unjustifiable similarity, is never permitted in individual assignments. Any submitted academic work may be subject to screening by software
programs designed to detect evidence of plagiarism or collaboration.
It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your computer accounts and your written work.
Do not share passwords with anyone, nor write your password down where it may be seen by others. Do
not change permissions to allow others to read your course directories and files. Do not walk away from a
workstation without logging out. These are your responsibilities. In groups that collaborate inappropriately, it may be impossible to determine who has offered work to others in the group, who has received
work, and who may have inadvertently made their work available to the others by failure to maintain
adequate personal security. In such cases, all will be held equally liable.
These policies and interpretations may be augmented by individual instructors for their courses. Always check the handouts and web pages of your course and section for additional guidelines.
8.3.3 Departmental Policy on Violations of Academic Integrity
Any student accused of a violation of academic integrity will be so notified by the course director. An informal review will be conducted, including a meeting between these parties. After this review and upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the following sanctions will be imposed. It is the policy of
40
8.4. Discontinuance of Study
this department that any violation of academic integrity will result in an F for the course, that all departmental financial support including teaching assistantship, research assistantship or scholarships be
terminated, that notification of this action be placed in the student’s confidential departmental record,
and that the student be permanently ineligible for future departmental financial support. A second violation of academic integrity will cause the department to seek permanent dismissal from the major and
bar from enrollment in any departmental courses. Especially flagrant violations will be considered under formal review proceedings, which may in addition to the above sanctions result in expulsion from
the University.
8.4 Discontinuance of Study
You may be asked to leave the Department for any of the following reasons:
1. receiving 4 or more grades of C or below in the courses you take;
2. failing to meet a requirement for some degree—e.g., failing to complete the breadth course requirements in the PhD Qualifying Process before the end of your 2nd year, or failing to have an approved
dissertation proposal by the end of your 4th year;
3. completing your MS degree and not being judged qualified to study for the PhD;
4. conduct warranting dismissal such as dishonesty or cheating.
If you are asked to leave the Department, you may apply by letter for permission to take additional
courses on a non-degree basis.

CHAPTER

ASSISTANTSHIPS
9.1 General Information
Three types of assistantships from the Department are available to graduate students:
Research Assistantships (RAs): in which you work with a faculty member or group on a (usually externally funded) research project.
Teaching Assistantships (TAs): in which you assist a faculty member in teaching and/or grading an undergraduate or graduate course, and may be in charge of leading one or more recitation sections of
that course. You may occasionally teach an undergraduate course yourself. Under current policy,
TAships are reserved for students in the PhD program.
Graduate (laboratory) Assistantships (GAs): in which you work in the departmental laboratory, usually
on software development, maintenance, and support.
Most funded students start out as TAs or GAs, unless approached prior to arrival by a faculty member
with an RA offer. Later, when you choose a major professor, that faculty member may have funding to
support you as an RA.
All assistantships require an average of 16–20 hours of work per week (see §9.5).
If you believe that your supervisor is giving you too much work to do, discuss this first with your
supervisor. If it is still not satisfactorily resolved, see the Director of Graduate Studies.
9.2 SPEAK Test
The University requires all graduate students who are non-native speakers of English and who are not
permanent residents or US citizens to pass the SPEAK test in order to teach. The Department of Computer
Science and Engineering can also require the test for other students who are non-native speakers. Failure
to pass the SPEAK test within the first year of your appointment may lead to a non-renewal of the TA or
GA. Information about the SPEAK test, its schedule, and other implications can be found at the following

43
9. ASSISTANTSHIPS
9.3 Eligibility, Renewals, and Limits on Financial Support
1. Eligibility for funding is determined in part by:
• the need for TAs, GAs, or RAs
• the availability of funds
• the student’s academic standing
• the student’s performance of duties
• the student’s score on the SPEAK test (if relevant)
• recommendations from the student’s major professor, advisor, or the instructor in charge of
courses for which the student has been a TA
• other relevant factors.
2. Normally, only PhD students are eligible for TAships or GAships, subject to the above eligibility
criteria. Both PhD and MS students are eligible for RAships, also subject to these criteria.
3. Students may be supported as a TA or GA for a total of no more than 10 semesters (not necessarily
consecutive), subject to the above eligibility criteria.
4. Students may be supported by RAships or fellowships (e.g., Presidential Fellowship, SEAS Dean’s
Fellowship, Fulbright, IGERT, etc.) for the amount of time allowed by the funding source, subject
to the above eligibility criteria. In some cases, this length of time may be greater than 10 semesters.
5. Exceptions to these rules may be considered by the department on an individual basis in consultation with the student’s major professor or other advisor.
9.4 Tuition Scholarship
A student with one of the three types of assistantships (RA, TA, or GA) or with certain fellowships is eligible
to have a tuition scholarship.
It is university policy that tuition scholarships are limited to 4 semesters of support for MS students
and to 8 semesters of support for PhD students. Certain other restrictions are spelled out in “Principles
and Policies for the Allocation and Award of Graduate Tuition Scholarships”, online at:
https://grad.buffalo.edu/explore/funding/tuition-scholarship.html
Tuition scholarships normally cover up to 9 hours of credit per semester towards a degree for students
whose full-time requirements are 9 credits. Students are eligible for tuition scholarship only up to the
number of credits required in any given semester for the degree for which they are working—for example,
students who only need to register for 1 credit of thesis guidance are only eligible for 1 credit of tuition
scholarship. The maximum number of credits of tuition scholarship is 30 for an MS student and 72 for a
PhD student through the first 4 years. University policy strictly prohibits tuition scholarships during the
summer.
Notes: According to UB policy,
44
9.5. Your Responsibilities as an Assistant
1. If, for example, you have obtained a PhD (or MS, respectively) degree and received tuition scholarship for 72 credits (or 30 credits, respectively) from another UB department, no tuition scholarship
will be provided for your study for a CSE degree.
2. If, for example, you are not supported during your first semester and paid tuition for 12 credits by
yourself, and transferred 3 credits from another university, then you are eligible to receive tuition
scholarship for only 15 (= 30−12−3) credits for MS degree or 57 credits for PhD degree.
9.5 Your Responsibilities as an Assistant
This policy is stated formally, in order to:
• set forth assistantship obligations clearly for graduate students and their supervisors, and
• establish commensurate obligations for the three kinds of assistantships we have—research assistantships (RA), teaching assistantships (TA), and graduate (laboratory) assistantships (GA).
The responsibilities of RAs, TAs, and GAs are as follows:
1. A student’s work obligation is an average of 16–20 hours a week. This is an average over the term of
appointment rather than a fixed amount each week.
2. Assistants are appointed for either one or two semesters. Assistants appointed for two semesters
are appointed for 10 months (normally from the second part of August to the end of May).
3. Academic holidays (and the inter-semester break) will normally be holidays for assistants. Some
assistants may be asked to work during such holidays in return for time off at some other time.
4. TAs are expected to work throughout the semester including the final exam period, starting a week
before the semester begins and continuing until the grading for the courses they are assigned to
is completed. TAs who are not available during the work period may have their assistantships
removed.
5. The obligation of RAs does extend after the end of classes in May until May 31, and extends further
if they have summer support. The obligation of TAs ends when they are released by their supervisor, presumably after final exams are graded.
6. TA performance is monitored by the instructor who fills out a TA evaluation form.
No supported student is required to accept an RAship with a particular faculty member. If you accept
an RAship, you should know that research is not a 9-to-5 activity. Accept an RAship only if you desire to
work with the faculty member for academic and scientific reasons, not just for the money. The work you
do as an RA should always be integrated into your academic career. For these reasons, the guidelines
given above (e.g., 16–20 hours per week) are open to negotiation. You should understand clearly what
the faculty member expects from you before you accept the RAship. Faculty members and their RAs may
agree to variations from the above guidelines.
45
9. ASSISTANTSHIPS
9.6 Department Resources
TAs may use the Department’s office supplies and equipment, but only for the courses they are helping to
teach. When you write a dissertation or project, we expect that you will pay for the materials and copying.
The University prohibits graduate students from using the telephones for long-distance calls. If you
must make a long-distance call in an emergency, please notify the office so that we can arrange for you
to pay for your call.
You may not take university-owned equipment out of the Department unless you fill out a Property
Removal Authorization form and have it signed by the Executive Officer.
9.7 Advice for Teaching Assistants
It is strongly recommended that you ask your students to fill out an evaluation form twice during the
semester: once at mid-semester (just after the midterm exam, if any) and once again at the end of the
semester. The mid-semester evaluation will be the most useful one, because it will indicate what you are
doing right and what you still have time to improve on! Two questions should suffice:
1. What aspects of recitation (or: the course) would you like to see changed?
2. What aspects of recitation (or: the course) do you especially like?
If you have never taught before, or if you are a foreign student not familiar with American undergraduate education, or even if you are an experienced teacher, you should find the following book useful.

DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEES
The Department has about a dozen regular standing committees that decide matters of department policy. Important questions may also be voted on by the faculty as a whole or by the students.
1. The Personnel Committee consists of all tenured faculty, with the Chair of the Department serving
as committee chair. It votes on hiring, tenure, and promotion of faculty. All Departmental personnel decisions, including new appointments, tenure, and promotion, are made by this committee,
and some by the sub-committee consisting of all full professors. The committee’s decisions are
passed on to the appropriate higher authority in the University.
2. The Executive Committee consists of the Chair of the Department, the Executive Officer, the Assistant to the Chair of the Department, the Director of Graduate Studies, the Director of Graduate Admissions, the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Director of Laboratories, the Chair
of the Facilities Committee, the immediate past Chair of the Department, and the Office Manager/Coordinator to the Chair of the Department. It coordinates the administrative activities of
the Department.
3. The Graduate Studies Committee consists of the Director of Graduate Studies (as chair), other faculty members (appointed by the Chairman of the Department), and graduate students (elected by
the CSEGSA). The chair of this committee supervises all graduate student programs and advisement, including monitoring degree progress, appointing doctoral committees, and promulgating
policies about RA, TA, and GA duties. This committee establishes graduate degree requirements,
graduate course offerings and content, and other related matters.
4. The Graduate Admissions Committee consists of the Director of Graduate Admissions (as chair)
and other faculty members (appointed by the Chairman of the Department). It determines admissions requirements and makes decisions about which students to admit.
5. The Undergraduate Affairs Committee consists of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (as chair),
other faculty members (appointed by the Chairman of the Department), and undergraduate students (elected by the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Association). The Director of Undergraduate Studies supervises all undergraduate students’ programs and advisement, including
